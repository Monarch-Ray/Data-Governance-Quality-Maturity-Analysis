# Data-Governance-Quality-Maturity-Analysis
## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on evaluating enterprise data governance and data quality maturity across multiple source systems. The analysis assesses key governance dimensions such as data completeness, business impact, and estimated remediation cost to identify high-risk data assets and prioritize governance efforts.The goal is to provide actionable insights that help organizations improve data reliability, reduce operational risk, and allocate remediation resources effectively.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Assess data quality maturity across source systems

- Measure average data completeness and business impact

- Estimate remediation costs associated with data quality issues

- Identify critical source systems requiring governance prioritization

- Enable data-driven decision-making for governance strategy

## 🧩 Dataset Description

The dataset represents enterprise data governance metrics across multiple source systems and data assets. It includes indicators related to data quality performance, risk exposure, and cost implications.

### Key fields include:

- Source System

- Data Asset / Domain

- Completeness Percentage

- Business Impact Score

- Estimated Remediation Cost

- Governance Risk Indicators

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Power BI – Data modeling, DAX calculations, and visualization

- DAX – Custom measures for averages, totals, and cost estimation

- ZoomCharts Drill Down Map Pro – Interactive exploration of source systems

- Data Modeling – Star schema and governance-focused metrics

## 🔍 Analysis & Key Insights

- Data quality maturity varies significantly across source systems

- A small number of systems contribute disproportionately to governance risk

- Remediation costs are highly concentrated in critical business domains

- Improving completeness in high-impact systems yields the greatest business value

- Governance prioritization can significantly reduce operational and compliance risk
